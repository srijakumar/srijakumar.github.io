I know KNOW the tic tac toe game - it was probably one of the first games I was introduced to as child and I have fond memories of spending quality time playing the game with my friends during class passing back and forth the game sheets. Of course, only after we had finished the assigned lessons!

When I encountered the challenge of making a terminal functional game of tic tac toe in Ruby, it felt warm, comfortable and exciting to marry a part of my childhood to my "adult" life. Boy, can I only compare my journey to Sam and Frodo's jouney from the Shire to Mordor - going through all the stages of excitement to start the journey, feeling of accomplishment at overcoming initial obstacles, weariness and despair at incessant obstacles, going off the beaten path to find new resources, accepting personal shortcomings and asking for help, hoping Gandalf will show up, and enjoying the hearty breakfast after the task is completed!

Majority of my issues with developing a Ruby tic tac toe game came from my umfamiliarity with the language. But what better way to learn a language - programming or lingual, than to learn by the process of total immersion. And hard work, of course! I reviewed the Ruby lessons leading up to the game sections a couple of times, checked out external resources, exhausted the "Ask a question" feature and sessions with technical coaches. Asking for help was my biggest challenge because somewhere in my subconscious, this translated to self depraciating questions like "you should know how to do it", "how would you be a good developer if you can't even code a tic tac toe game" and of course "is this the right path for me". There were moments when I wanted to put Ruby on hold and move on to the more familiar territory of Javascript. Silencing those self doubt monsters took various levels of mental and emotional strength and I am glad I did because otherwise I wouldn't have had the chance to experience the unadulterated joy of the moment when all the tests passed and voila! my game was asking me to input my turn! I called up my mom and set up a skype screen share so she could play the game. She did not see why I was so excited but that did not dampen my spirirts. 

Completing the tic tac toe game boosted my self confidence for the upcoming chapters and motivated me that if I can brave through the unfamiliar and unchartered terriroty of Ruby, I am not going to give up on the rest of the topics - some of them more familiar than the other. I can only sum up what I learnt from this gruelling journey in a more eloquently composed Albus Dumbledore quote - "Help will always be given [at Hogwarts] to those who ask for it.

P.S. My favorite external resource was this Lynda introductory lesson that really cemented my foundations and helped me build on them to complete this game. [lesson](http://https://www.lynda.com/Ruby-tutorials/Welcome/47905/57934-4.html?autoplay=true)
