I am Srija. I am a traveller and that is what brought me to programming.

Sometimes I travel through planes and trains; sometimes I travel through books and the magic they weave; and, now I have discovered traveling through codes. With every coding assignment and project, I am on a different jouney guided by the expectations of the assignment or client, supported by different sets of resources, challenged by new hurdles, coming out (hopefully) wiser every time - but culminating in the same sense of pride and joy in creating something. And, I don't even have to leave the city!

My first interaction with a programming language was as an undergrad physics research assistant working with Fotran to analyze the impact of changing various parameters on the evolution of stars from gas nebulae. Working with multiple lines of legacy codes was not the best first introduction to programming but when the programs would compile and generate little graphs, it would make all the hours spent debugging legacy codes, interjecting new ones and google-ing error messages worth it! My next interaction was a more fun one with a C++ class where the final exam was to code LEGO® MINDSTORMS® NXT robots to complete a hurdle race. That final gave me a sense of achievement far greater than I had anticipated. Since then I have been hooked, dabbling with various code school, code academy, coursea, udacity online resources, attending Women Who Code meetups, bombarding with friends with questions, conducting informational interviews with professional software engineers and doing pro bono work for various non profits. What really drove my desire to take a plunge into the coding world with a structured study course was collabrating with some agriculture research students in a 2017 Bitcamp Hackathon to create an interactive website to report insect pests and track outbreaks by farmers. It was 36 hours of non stop coding, taking breaks to only clear our heads and presenting our work at the end of the sessions to the judges. While we did not win any of the awards, I did come out of the hackathon knowing that is what I want to do and here I am!
