#### Introduction:
Code emulates life. With Flatiron Full Stack Web Development, I have seen this reflected in multiple ways. CLI Data Gem is the first project where I got a chance to apply different aspects of programming that we learnt in different discrete sections. We learnt how to interact with the classes, differentiate between different types of methods, apply scraping to get pieces of a website – all in the safe environment of their specific sections following the material. The learning was more focused and streamlined – we did not have to delve into the stack of all new information to choose which notecard to pick out. This data gem allowed me to do that. Very similar to real life where one learns the differential equation in the math class, Newton’s laws of motion in the physics call before combining it all together to build a single rotor helicopter.

#### Idea:
In those copious lines of instructions on this project, I grabbed onto something that sounded familiar – scraping. Okay, I had recently finished a lab about scraping, which felt familiar. Living in the heart of politics, I decided to scrape the Washington Post website to display the 5 most read headlines to the user. The user could then select one of five article headlines to display the complete article. That was the idea!

#### Process:
Now let’s talk about the process. The first thing I wanted to determine was that this website is “scrapable” (so to speak). Scraping is exactly what it sounds like. You pick and choose (or scrape) the pieces of the website for your own personal/business needs. Have you ever found yourself shuffling between two or more websites and thought “Man, I wish I could pick and choose the certain aspects of these websites together in one place!”. Well, look no further, scraping to the rescue!

Once I had decided on the “parent” website, I needed to confirm that this website had specific identifiable tags associated with the news headline, author and the article that I wanted to display to the user.

As you can see the 5 headlines are wrapped in

Issue making tags specific

What would the user see:

Working from front to back



#### The Future:
There are multiple ways I can enhance this application! A 2.0 version of this app could allow a user to enter the zip code and see the top most read headlines from the local newspaper. A 3.0 version could allow the user to view the top headlines in specific categories. The list is endless. All I need is more skills on how to build them!
